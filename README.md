# Task-6-Sales-Trend-Analysis-Using-Aggregations
This task analyzes monthly sales performance using SQL aggregation functions. The dataset (online_sales) contains order details with dates, amounts, and product IDs. Queries extract monthly revenue (SUM(amount)) and order volume (COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) grouped by year and month. The results help identify seasonal trends, peak sales months.
